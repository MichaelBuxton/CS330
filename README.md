# CS330

Unfortunately, I was only able to add the source.cpp file from my scene as it said my zipped file was much to large to upload to github.

How do I approach designing software?
  Through this class, I gained a very good skill of checking my work extremely often.  Often times when working through this project, I would make just a simple change where I knew what the change would do to the rendering but I would run the project just to double check that I was correct in the change.  Along with that, I did more research than I ever have before I did any coding to attempt to gain the best understanding and most knowledge that I can before going into my project to work. Both of these skills can be used going forward in almost any coding capactiy which will be massive advantages going forward.  
  
How do I approach developing programs?
  Approaching developing programs I feel goes along a little bit with my answer to the previous question.  I use those skills still to develop any program but now I pay good attention to the setup of the project as well.  It a 3d rendering scene such as this, one of the most important things is to know that you scene is set up correctly and can handle everything that you are about to put in to it.  Iteration factored a lot into my scene as any time you can use iteration rather than having to list out every single instance of something saves a lot of time and lowers risks of creating errors.  Working through the milestones I also gained a better understanding on how to use visual studio as well as it was farily new to me when the class first starting.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science is essential to reaching my goals as that is what I am going into for a career.  This class in particular will nto do a whole lot for me as I currently work as a back end java developer, but it is something that could help me down the road for sure.  Speaking in terms of my educational pathway, this is also the very last class that I needed to complete my computer science degree so I will be completely done with school moving forward.  Knowledge in terms of computer science though can always be gain so I will always be looking to better my skills and expand my knowledge going forward.
